I am a Research Scientist at the Cooperative Institute for Research in the Environmental Sciences (CIRES). I am broadly interested in applied mathematics and how it can be used to understand Earth’s atmosphere. 

I graduated from Haverford College with a bachelor’s in mathematics and then earned my Ph.D. in mathematics with a focus on applied math from The University of Wisconsin-Madison. I then held a joint appointment at the University of California-Davis between the Department of Land, Air, and Water Resources, and the Mathematics Department, where I was a Krener Assistant Professor.

### Research Interests

* **Tropical Climate Dynamics:** Investigating subseasonal-to-seasonal variability, such as the Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO), and how modal interference impacts its evolution and predictability.
* **Convective Circulations:** Modeling the influence of the non-traditional Coriolis force, radiation, and drag on balanced convective flows in stratified atmospheres.
* **Numerical Methods for Climate Models:** Designing accurate, robust, and conservative geometric algorithms for regridding and remapping on the sphere to improve the coupling and efficiency of Earth system models.
